###Spencer - Project 1


This is my first javasript application.  
It was written using HTML/CSS/JS/Jquery.

###As of 7/21/15
	### Features
	-Layout is mostly complete
	-Game completes till end and resets
	-Features multiple decks, hints, and active markers
	-If there is a bust, checks for aces and converts them to 1's.

	### Bugs
	-Have yet to figure out all of the logic for game winning. Sometimes winner is wrong. (if you are both under 21 and and dealer is higher, it says player wins).


### Lots of work/fun
	- I definitely learned a lot about Javascript making this project but it is clear there is a lot to learn.
	- The hardest part I have realized is doing complex functions and writing simple code.  Need to work on being DRY.
